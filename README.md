## 💡 The Problem

Small businesses spend **20+ hours/week** on repetitive tasks:
- Answering the same customer questions over and over
- Creating content for multiple social platforms
- Manually tracking what competitors are doing
- Following up with leads that go cold

**Result:** Burnout, missed opportunities, and slow growth.

---

## ✨ Our Solution

**Viralis** is an AI-powered platform that automates these tasks so businesses can focus on what matters.

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **🎙️ AI Voice Agent** | Answers calls 24/7, qualifies leads, books appointments—sounds human |
| **🎨 Content Studio** | Generates branded content for YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn |
| **🔍 Competitor Spy** | Tracks competitor activities and alerts you in real-time |
| **📊 Lead Management** | AI-scores leads based on engagement and buying signals |

---

## 🎯 Key Innovation

### Real-Time Voice AI Pipeline

We built a **sub-500ms latency** voice agent using a 3-stage streaming architecture:

```
Customer Speaks → Deepgram STT → Gemini 3 Flash → Deepgram TTS → Customer Hears
                     (Ears)          (Brain)          (Voice)
```

**Why it matters:** Most voice bots feel robotic with 2-3 second delays. Ours feels like talking to a real person.

### Super Link Technology

Every business gets a unique URL (`viralis.io/meet/your-brand`) that customers can click to instantly talk to their AI receptionist—no app download, no phone number needed.
